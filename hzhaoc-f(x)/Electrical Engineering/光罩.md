A photomask is a fused silica (quartz) plate, typically 6 inches (~152mm) square, covered with a pattern of opaque, transparent, and phase-shifting areas that are projected onto wafers in the lithography process to define the layout of one layer of an integrated circuit. Several masks are used in turn, each one reproducing a layer of the completed design, and together they are known as a **mask set**. The size of a photomask is not tied to wafer size, and 6-inch photomasks are typically used in lithography tools that expose 300mm or 200mm wafers.

In a wafer fab, a photomask is loaded into a lithography tool that passes light through the photomask to project the pattern onto the wafer surface. These patterns guide the deposition or removal of material from the wafer in subsequent patterning steps to read more about patterning). For each layer of the device, material is deposited or removed in those areas not covered by the photomask image, and a different photomask is used for each successive layer. This patterning process occurs multiple times on silicon wafers throughout chip fabrication, creating multiple layers of circuitry and interconnecting billions of transistors.

## Patterning
Patterning uses the process of photolithography and optical masks to print patterns that guide the deposition or removal of material from the wafer at specific steps in the device fabrication process. At each layer of the device, material is deposited or removed in those areas not covered by the mask and then a new mask is used for the next layer. The wafer is repeatedly processed in this fashion, creating multiple layers of circuitry.
