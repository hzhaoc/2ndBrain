## mission
Polkadot will enable a completely decentralized web where users are in control.

Polkadot is built to connect private and consortium chains, public and permissionless networks, oracles, and future technologies that are yet to be created. Polkadot facilitates an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information and transactions in a trustless way via the Polkadot relay chain.

Polkadot makes it easier than ever to create and connect decentralized applications, services, and institutions. By empowering innovators to build better solutions, we seek to free society from its reliance on a broken web where its large institutions canâ€™t violate our trust.

## developers
he Web3 Foundation is partnering with best-in-class entities to build Polkadot and foster development of the services and applications that will run on it.

Researchers from Inria Paris and ETH Zurich, developers from Parity Technologies, and capital partners from crypto-funds such as Polychain Capital are all working together to develop a superlative realization of Web3, with Polkadot at its core.

Web3 Foundation is [providing grants](https://medium.com/web3foundation/build-with-web3-and-polkadot-30fef47d9a8d) for development of the ecosystem.
