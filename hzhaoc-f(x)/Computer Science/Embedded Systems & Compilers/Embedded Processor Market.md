## categories by functions
as of **2010**
- **computational micros**
	- general purpose processors, such as CPUs of mainframes, PCs, workstations, servers, high-end portable devices. Most RISC or CISC based engines belong to this
- **embedded general purpose micros**
	- scaled-down versions of computational micros, such as ARM (Advanced RISC Machines), MIPS, x86
- **digital signal processor** (DSP)
	- focus on efficient execution of arithmetic operations in tight loop-oriented kernels. future will be VLIW-like designed (predictable and regular arithmetic code that has lots of ILP). market leaders: Texas Instruments, Motorola
- **microcontrollers**
	- industrial processors for standalone operations such as: memory, I/O, buses, peripherals in addition to a simple processing unit.
- **network processors**
	- similar to DSP in that it has incomplete connection networks and application-specific pipelines.
	- unlike DSP, it's usually programmed in assembly language, hard to compile. 
	- unlike DSP, it does not have high ILP, will not likely use VLIW structure in future
