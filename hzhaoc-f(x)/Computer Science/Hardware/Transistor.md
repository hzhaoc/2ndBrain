A **transistor** is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of modern [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"). It is composed of [[Semiconductor]] material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A [[Voltage]] or [[Current]] applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can **amplify a signal**. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in [[Integrated Circuit]].
