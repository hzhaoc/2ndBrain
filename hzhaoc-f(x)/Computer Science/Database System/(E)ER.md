## Ch3: Entity-Relationship Model (ER)

ER describes data as **entities** , **relationships** , and **attributes**.

- **Attributes types** : composite vs simple (atomic); single-valued vs multivalued; stored vs derived; null; key attribute of an entity type; domains (value sets) of an attribute.

- **Weak entity types** : entities that do not have key attributes of their own. They tend to have **partial key** that relates to **owner/parent entity**. A **weak entity** has **total participation** in **identifying relationship** with its **owner entity**.

- **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**: an alternative notation for class diagrams, proposed as a standard for conceptual object modeling.

- **Partial participation** vs **total participation** in relationships.

## Ch4: Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model

_Inheritance, subclass/superclass_

- **Subclass/superclass relationship**
- **Generalization/specialization**
- **Attribute inheritance**

_Constraints of specialization/specialization_

- **Predicate-defined specialization**
- **Attribute-defined specialization:** All subclasses in a specialization have their membership condition on the same attribute of the superclass.
- **User-defined:** membership in subclass is determined by user.
- **Disjointness constraint**
- **Completeness** or **totalness constraint:** a total specialization constraint specifies that every entity in the superclass must be a member of at least one subclass in the specialization.

_Specialization Hierarchies, Lattices_

A specialization hierarchy has the constraint that every subclass has only one superclass â€“ namely a tree structure or strict hierarchy. In contrast, a specialization lattice has the constraint that a subclass can have more than one superclass.

_Specialization vs generalization_

Specialization is often used in top-down conceptual refinement; generalization is often used in bottom-up conceptual synthesis.

_Union Type (Category)_

A category holds a subset of union of its superclasses.

A member in category must exist in only one of its superclasses. A category can be **total** or **partial**. A total union case can be converted total disjoint specialization case.
