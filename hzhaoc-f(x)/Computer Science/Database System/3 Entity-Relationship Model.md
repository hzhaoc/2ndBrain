## Ch3: Entity-Relationship Model (ER)

ER describes data as **entities** , **relationships** , and **attributes**.

- **Attributes types** : composite vs simple (atomic); single-valued vs multivalued; stored vs derived; null; key attribute of an entity type; domains (value sets) of an attribute.

- **Weak entity types** : entities that do not have key attributes of their own. They tend to have **partial key** that relates to **owner/parent entity**. A **weak entity** has **total participation** in **identifying relationship** with its **owner entity**.

- **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**: an alternative notation for class diagrams, proposed as a standard for conceptual object modeling.

- **Partial participation** vs **total participation** in relationships.
