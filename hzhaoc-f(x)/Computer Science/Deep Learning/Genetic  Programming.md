# Concept
With genetic algorithms, each new generation is created through mating/mutation of individuals in the previous population (then their fitness is evaluated). Through numerous operations of this process, it will eventually produce the best individual - one whose fitness is better than everyone else‚Äôs in the population and cannot get any better

Key words:
- Individual
- Population
- Objective
- Fitness
- Evaluate
- Selection
- Mate / Crossover
- Mutate
- Algorithms (various evolutionary algorithms)

**Individual**: one specific candidate in the population (with properties such as DNA)
  
**Population**: group of individuals whose properties will be altered

**Objective**: a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize (usually the goal is to increase objective through the evolutionary algorithm)
  
**Fitness**: relative comparison to other individuals; how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to the rest of the population?

**Evaluation**: a function that computes the objective of an individual

## Selection
   
Selection: represents ‚Äòsurvival of the fittest‚Äô; gives preference to better individuals, therefore allowing them to pass on their genes

- **Fitness** Proportionate: the greater the fitness value,  
the higher the probability of being selected for mating

- **Tournament**: several tournaments among individuals  
(number of individuals in each tournament is  
dependent on tournament size); winners are selected for mating

### Tournament
#### Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II  (NSGA II)
- Population is separated into nondomination ranks
- Individuals are selected using a binary tournament
- Lower Pareto ranks beat higher Pareto ranks
- For example, an individual on the blue front will beat out an individual on the orange front
- Ties on the same front are broken by crowding distance
- Summation of normalized Euclidian distances to all points within the front
- Higher crowding distance wins
#### Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)
- Each individual is given a strength S
- S is how many others in the population it dominates
- Each individual receives a rank R
- R is the sum of S‚Äôs of the individuals that dominate it
- Pareto individuals are nondominated and receive an R of 0
- A distance to the kth nearest neighbor (ùõîk) is calculated and a fitness of R + 1/(ùõîk + 2) is obtained

## Mate/Mutate
-  Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
-  Mutate: introduces random modifications; purpose is to maintain diversity

## Algorithm
Algorithms: various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual
```
1.Randomly initialize population
2.Determine fitness of population
3.Repeat‚Ä¶ 
	1.select parents from population
	2.perform crossover on parents creating population
	3.perform mutation of population
	4.determine fitness of population
‚Ä¶ until best individual is good enough.
```

## Individual  representation
We can represent a program as a tree structure. The tree is converted to a **lisp preordered parse** tree.

- **Nodes** are called **primitives** and represent **functions**
- **Leaves** are called **terminals** and represent **parameters**
- The input can be thought of as a particular type of terminal.
- The output is produced at the root of the tree.

## Pareto Frontier
- An individual is Pareto if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives
- The set of all Pareto individuals is known as the Pareto frontier
- These individuals represent unique contributions
- We want to drive selection by favoring Pareto individuals
- But maintain diversity by giving all individuals some probability of mating
