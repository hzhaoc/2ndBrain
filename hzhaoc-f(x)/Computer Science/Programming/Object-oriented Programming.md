## Program

### Program is a series of Python statements to accomplish a specific task.

1.  Four basic patterns to construct programs:

    1.  Sequential code

    2.  Conditional code (e.g. if statements)

    3.  Repetitive code (loops)

    4.  Store and reuse (e.g. functions)

2.  Structure: Input -\> Program -\> Output

3.  Encapsulation

### Object-Oriented Programming

1.  Class

2.  Inheritance

3.  Attribute vs. Method

    1.  Attribute

> Attribute is variables stored in class or class instance

2.  Method

> Method is functions stored in class or class instance
