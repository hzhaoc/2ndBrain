# Computer processor power consumption
## Active power
$P=\frac{1}{2}CV^2f\alpha$
where
$P$ is power in watts
$C$ is capacitance, about linear to chip area
$V$ is voltage
$f$ is clock frequency
$\alpha$ is activity factor

## Static power
As voltage goes lower, dynamic power goes down, and static power goes up due to leakage. There's a minimum power solution where voltage is either not too high or too low.

# Fabrication cost
Because of defects, roundness of wafer and squareness of chip, fabrication cost per chip is not linearly with size of chip but higher, given a fixed cost of one wafer.
