Electric current is ordered movement of electric [[Electromagnetism|charges]]. These charges are called current carriers. In metals and [[Computer Hardware|semiconductors]], [[Electromagnetism|electrons]] are current carriers; in [[Electromagnetism|electronlytes]] and [[Electromagnetism|ionized gases]], positive and negative [[Electromagnetism|ions]].

# Current Density
In electromagnetism, current density is the amount of charge per unit time that flows through a unit area of a chosen cross section.
