Electric current is ordered movement of electric [[Electricity|charges]]. These charges are called current carriers. In metals and [[Computer Hardware|semiconductors]], [[Electricity|electrons]] are current carriers; in [[Electricity|electronlytes]] and [[Electricity|ionized gases]], positive and negative [[Electricity|ions]].

# Current Density
In electromagnetism, current density is the amount of charge per unit time that flows through a unit area of a chosen cross section.
