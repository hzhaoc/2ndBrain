**Electrical resistivity** and its reverse **electrical conductivity**, describe an intrinsic property of a material that quantifies how strongly it resists or conducts electric [[Electricity|current]]. Low resistivity materials are usually referred to as **conductors**, high resistivity materials are usually referred to as **insulators**, mid resistivity materials are usually referred to as [[Computer Hardware|semiocnductors]]. Common unit of measure: $\Omega*m$.

# Calculation
## from shape
For an idea material whose cross-section are uniform across it, electric field are parallel, and current density are constant everywhere, resistivity can be calculated by:
$$\rho=R\frac{A}{l}$$
where 
$\rho$ is resistivity,
$R$ is resistance,
$l$ is length,
$A$ is cross-sectional area.

## from temperature
Resistivity is also related to temperature, for most metals when temperature change is within a certain range, the relationship is approximately linear:
$$\rho=\rho_0(1+\alpha t)$$
where 
$\rho_0$ is when temperature is $0^{\circ}C$,
$\alpha$ is a coefficient, for many metals in normal temperatures it's around $0.004$.

## from electromagnetism
Resistivity can also be calculated by [[Electricity|Current]] and [[Electricity|Electric Field]]:
$$\rho=\frac{E}{J}$$
where
$E$ is magnitude of electric field,
$J$ is magnitude of current density.
