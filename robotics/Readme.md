My view of skill range for building a full-stack robotics system
- overall CAD mechatronics design
- modular breakdown (for different mechanical parts)
- for each mechanical part, system breakdown 
	- electronics
		- PCB CAD design (AutoDesk Fusion, KiCad)
		- PCB manufacturing
		- firmware flashing
		- soldering
		- auxiliary: wires, tools, pins, resistors, emulator etc.
	- mechanics
		- plastic (PLA/ABS/etc)
			- 3D printing
				- CAD design & slicing (PruseSlicer)
				- bed leveling
		- metal
			- purchase
			- machined
				- CAD design (AutoDesk Fusion, SolidWorks)
	- software
